# Simple BJJ API
This is a simple API built using Brazilian Jiu Jitsu grapplers and their unique traits.

**Link to project:** https://github.com/mehul-rana/Simple-BJJ-API

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

The purpose of this project is to strengthen and enhance my introductory knowledge of building out API's and further practice using Javascript in the backend via Node.js and Express

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Further increase the number of grapplers in the database and add a way to dynamically add HTML to the webpage using EJS (Embedded JavaScript)

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first attempt in building an API. Having just learned how to use JavaScript in the backend, I wanted to attempt to put in practice what I've learned with Node.js and Express.
